Originally developed by Adam Kirk for testing iOS devices that use the AddressBook framework.  Build it onto your simulator or device and use the UI to specify the number of random contacts to generate and a group to add them to.  I will continually improve this until I feel that it is satisfactory for fully testing apps that utilize the AB framework.  drycleanonly at mysterioustrousers dot com
